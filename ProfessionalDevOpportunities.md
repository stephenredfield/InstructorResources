# Opportunities for your Professional Development

There are numerous opportunities for Professional Development at Oregon State.  The purpose of this page is to provide an overview of the most accessible opportunities, not an exhaustive list.  For any PD opportunities with associated costs, see [Funding your Professional Development](ProfessionalDevFunding.html) guidance in getting your PD paid for.

## Online CS Instructor Training Retreat

Part of your employment as an Online Instructor at OSU is attendance at the twice-yearly Instructor Training Retreats (ITR).  These are scheduled to coincide with the [Career Showcase](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/online-cs-students/current-students/career-services/career-showcase) so there are also fantastic opportunities to meet our students face-to-face.  Attendance at these is mandatory, but the School of EECS pays for travel/lodging/meals for the events.  The events are traditionally held the Monday after Fall term ends, and the Monday after Spring term ends.

Topic coverage at the ITRs varies depending on the perceived needs of the Program.

## Online CS Webinars

The Online CS program offers approximately-monthly webinars for Online CS instructors.  These cover a wide array of topics and attendance (or viewing of the recording after the fact) is strongly encouraged.  Topics vary but are generally specific to Online CS education and useful skill/information for our Online CS Instructors.

## OSU Professional and Continuing Education (PACE)

Professional development funds can be applied toward any relevant [PACE courses and certificates](https://workspace.oregonstate.edu/). If any PACE courses appeal to you, submit the request document described in [Funding your Professional Development](ProfessionalDevFunding.html) to your supervisor.

Ecampus offers numerous trainings, events, and workshops throughout the year.  These are generally free and are always web-accessible.
