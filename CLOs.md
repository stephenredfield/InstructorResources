# Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)

Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) are the foundation upon which every course is built.  Learning outcomes identify the depth and type of learning that is expected in the course, tell students what is important in a course, and provide them with a description of what they can expect to learn.

When designing a course, it is vital to ensure that not only are the outcomes written in such a way that they are measurable, but that the learning content supports these outcomes.  This [Ecampus module](https://courses.ecampus.oregonstate.edu/building_effective_learning_outcomes/story_html5.html){:target="\_blank"} will walk you through the differences between course-level outcomes and module-level outcomes, with a focus on Measurability, Alignment, and insight from Bloom's Taxonomy.
