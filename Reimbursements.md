## Qualifying for Reimbursement

Approved Professional Development activities can be reimbursed from your $1,500/year Instructor Professional Development fund. Ecampus also fund some Professional Development activities. For details on getting a Professional Development activity approved see [Funding my Professional Development](FundingProfessionalDevelopment.html){:target="\_blank"}.

Additionally, according to OSU Guidelines, any travel which requires you to leave 2 hours earlier, or arrive home 2 hours later than, your normal work day qualifies you for limited 'Per Diem'. Any travel to a location other than your normal work space also qualifies you for mileage reimbursement. There are some special cases (such as meals accompanying Faculty Hiring, or special events). If you have questions about whether something qualifies, contact [Tara DiSante](mailto:tara.disante@oregonstate.edu).

## General Reimbursement Guidelines

- Reimbursements and accompanying documentation must be filed within 60 days of incurring the expense.
- Foreign Travel Authorization (FTA) is **required** before booking grant-related international travel.
