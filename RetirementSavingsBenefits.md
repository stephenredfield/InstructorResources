to inform faculty of the retirement savings benefits available as an OSU employee.

This page is a placeholder (and reminder) to provide new faculty with information
regarding retirement savings benefits at OSU.

Keep an eye our for a Retirement Plan Notification email sent to your OSU email
account in your fourth month of employment.

First, you select one of two main plans: PERS or ORP.

Then, you can opt-in to additional savings within each main plan.
