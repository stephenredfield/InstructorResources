# Getting Promoted to Senior Instructor

During Summer 2020, the OSU Faculty Union (UAOSU) successfully bargained for a reduction in the "time served" requirement for promotion from Instructor to Senior Instructior I, and likewise from SI-1 to SI-2. The exact language regarding this can be viewed on the [UAOSU Site](https://www.uaosu.org/contract/) but is abbreviated here:

> All Instructors ... are eligible to apply for promotion this coming academic year if they began employment at OSU no later than Fall 2017 and **will have accumulated at least 3.0 FTE years in service by the end of the 2020-2021 academic year**. Previously promoted faculty in these categories are eligible for their second promotion to Senior II if they were promoted no later than Fall 2017 and will, by the end of the 2020-2021 academic year, **have accumulated 3.0 FTE years in service since promotion**.  
            - [UAOSU Timely Update](https://www.uaosu.org/2020/08/13/timely-contract-highlights-for-fixed-term-faculty/)

To clarify, 1.0 FTE year is one year of service at your annually contracted service duration, so 9 months for 9-months contracted instructors and 12 months for 12-month instructors.

## The Promotion Process

The process for promotion in the Instructor track is not simple at OSU, but it can be navigated with a little preparation and a fair amount of time.

### Understand the Dossier

The **Promotion Dossier** on the [CoE Promotion and Tenure Page](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/promotion-tenure) is a document which will be partially completed by you, some of your references, the Department (via a committee and the Head), and the College.  The absolute **best** thing you can do to ease your promotion process is to download it _**now**_ and treat it as a living document:

- _Keep your Candidate Statement (Section V) in at least an outline form_, updated yearly
- Utilize the annual performance review preparation to _update your Vita (Section VIII) with current information_.
    - To aid in this, keep careful track of tasks you complete throughout the year
    - This section doesn't have a length limit so include all pertinent activities and highlight those that contributed beyond expectations.
- When you have a particularly strong connection with a student, take note of their name and ask if they'd ever be willing to write a letter of recommendation on your behalf.

### Understand the Timeline

The current requirements allow you to apply for promotion after 3.0 FTE years of service in rank.  The promotion process itself will take _one whole_ year, which is interspersed with interviews, revisions, teaching observations, etc...  For a complete listing of the various deadlines, check the"**Annual timeline for COE promotion and tenure activities** on the [CoE Promotion and Tenure Page](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/promotion-tenure). It is non-trivial to understand, but the really important dates and time-frames to look for are...

1. The entire "Initial Dossier (Candidate's Portion)" Section
    - This is the section where you notify the department of your candidacy and work on building your initial dossier, submit, receive feedback, revise, and resubmit. It is the bulk of your role in the process.
    - The department has also started providing P&T mentors which will help you in preparation of your Dossier.
2. "Peer evaluation of teaching"
    - For this the EECS P&T Committee will task several (2-3) reviewers to observe your teaching, perhaps interview you, and write a letter in support (or not) of your promotion.
    - It is recommended to use the OSU [Peer-Review of Online Teaching Guidelines](https://senate.oregonstate.edu/sites/senate.oregonstate.edu/files/peer_review_observation_formrev.pdf) since course observation of online courses is very different from traditional courses
3. "Candidate Signs Section X of the Dossier that the open part of the dossier is complete (No dossier changes allowed after this date)"
    - In this section you may sign away permission to view the dossier in its entirety (possibly containing negative reviews and letters)
    - If you're unsure about this, ask your supervisor
4. Unit head: Meet with candidate
    - In this time-frame you'll meet 1:1 with the School Head to review the internal letters and learn whether or not they will support your promotion.
    - This is also an opportunity to chat with the School Head about your role changes as a promoted Instructor.
5. Dean: Meet with candidate
    - In this time-frame you'll meet 1:1 with the Dean of CoE to talk about the promotion process and learn whether or not they will support your promotion.
    - You seldom get a chance to have a 1:1 with the Dean - use it wisely!
