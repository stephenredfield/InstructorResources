# Course Administration Module

Because courses may transition from instructor to instructor, it is recommended for the Course Owner to develop and maintain a **Course Administration Module**.  This module would be unpublished (so students won't see it) but would contain useful information for instructors of the course, including...

- Relationships between CLOs and Assessments (ABET)
- Common "sticking points" for students
- Recommended course improvements
- Links to any known online plagiarism sources
