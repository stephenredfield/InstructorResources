# Funding your Professional Development

There are several ways to fund your Professional Development at Oregon State University.  Regardless of the funding source, it is important to provide a justification document to your supervisor and/or any other stakeholders.  This document will first enumerate funding sources and requirements, then guide you in the creation of a funding request document.

## Instructor P.D. Funding

As an Online Instructor in Computer Science in the School of EECS, you are provided with up to $1,500 per academic year of funds earmarked for professional development.  These funds can also supplement professional development funded through another source which may not fully cover expenses. Other costs it can be used to pay for include, but are not limited to, courses, learning materials and supplies, and conferences.  If you have an idea which isn't listed here, please contact your supervisor to verify that it is something which can be funded.
