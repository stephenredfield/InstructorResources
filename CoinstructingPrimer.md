# Co-instructing - A Primer

## History

As the Online CS program grew and more and more students enrolled, class sizes ballooned.  In only a few years, course enrollment rose from 20-30 students per section to over a hundred, and it continued to rise.  Courses that were developed before and during this time tended to have a larger focus on project work, individual evaluation, and open-ended questions.  As courses grew in scale and it became apparent that, even with GTA support, it was extremely difficult to provide the level of feedback necessary for these projects (and the time needed to grade open-ended questions) there was a shift in course design practices toward automated evaluation, more active learning with instructors and TAs in supportive engagement roles.  Many courses continued to grow beyond and the decision was made to begin splitting courses into multiple sections (400, 401, ...).  To ensure all students receive the same quality of education, and to maintain the community of learning that develops around large-enrollment classes, the decision was made to have instructors share the responsibility (and the course sections) for these courses.  This document is intended to provide tips for instructors finding themselves in this position.

## Shared Tools - Canvas, Piazza, Slack

Within the Online CS program we want to ensure all our students have a positive learning experience, and get the most possible out of our classes.  To that end, the decision was made to have all multiple-section courses (courses with more than one section number in the 400s) to share all learning resources.  This means that all of the following should be common across sections.

- Syllabus
- Piazza Discussion Board
- Synchronous Channel (Slack, Teams)
- Office Hours
- Learning Materials
- Assignments and Grading Methods
- Exams and Grading Methods

Clearly the only feasible method of doing this is to [merge all relevant sections](CourseMerge.html), so that is the method to be used.  But how do you work _with_ another instructor to manage this?

## Course Aspects

The first step in sharing workload is to meet with your co-instructor and talk things through with them.  Sometimes the relationship and mentalities of co-instructors makes this somewhat trivial, but other times a more systemic approach is needed.  If so, breaking down the general duties associated with the task may help.  A (somewhat abbreviated) breakdown of course tasks and the level which they are connected to other course tasks (1 being "related to" and 2 being "vital to"). Clearly these are debatable but presented to provoke thought...

|Assignment Feedback|2|2|0|0|1|0||
|Plagiarism Reporting|1|2|0|0|0|0|1|

From this we can draw a network map of "interconnectivity"...

![Instructor Responsibility Interconnectedness](images/ResponsibilityInterconnection.png).

In theory, it would therefore be possible to divide the course along the lines of "least interconnectedness", separating out responsibilities as follows:

- Instructor A
  - Quiz Updates
  - Assignment Updates
- Instructor B
  - TA Management
  - Assignment Grading/Feedback
  - Plagiarism Reporting
- All Instructors
  - Engagement, Synchronous
  - Engagement, Asynchronous

This is a feasible solution to the problem. The "Instructor A" role naturally aligns itself with the course owner, since they are responsible for Quiz/Assignment/Learning Material updates (with some delegation to other instructors).  If the owner is actively teaching the course, this works well.  It also makes sense from a **group work** mentality to have some separation of tasks among group members.  The difficulty therefore arises mostly in managing engagement.
