# Pre-term Checklist Guide

The intent of this document is to provide a handy checklist of items which each OnlineCS Post-Bacc course must contain by the start of each term, as well as providing information on how to create/link to each of the items.

**Required Items are BOLD**.

Upon completion of this list, test whether the Syllabus page is visible in the correct format to current and prospective students. To do so, utilize a cache-free browser mode such as Chrome's Incognito, browse to the [myCOE course list](http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs), and click the link for your class.
